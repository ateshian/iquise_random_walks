# Quantum Waddle

A tutorial on 1D and 2D quantum walks using Qiskit, with real quantum hardware.

## How to run

Run the python notebooks in the submissions folder:

- The tutorial notebook helps you gain intuition for a quantum walk on a discrete quantum circuit
- The 1D and 2D quantum walks compare classical random walks, a simulated quantum walk and a quantum walk on IBM hardware.
